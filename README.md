_Videos_ is a new media player application for the GNOME Desktop leveraging a
bunch of new technologies available in the GNOME ecosystem that are currently
under-utilised by more established applications like [Totem].

_Videos_ aims to fit into the GNOME/GTK application space with a user-friendly
UI, use of modern GTK3 widgets and a similar look-and-feel common to GNOME
appliance applications.

**Asset licensing**: The lovely initial state graphic was lifted from an [old
mock-up for Totem by Allan Day][totem-mockup]. The contents of that repository
are licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0], so to make things a little more
straight-forward all the graphics included in this repository are under the same
license.

**About the name**: `gnome-videos` is mostly a working name, to be changed in
the future. The implication of endorsement from/cooperation with the GNOME
Foundation, whist obvious, is unintended.

Drop us a line if you have an idea for a name!
